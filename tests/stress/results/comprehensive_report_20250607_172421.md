### Test Results Files

### Recommendations

Based on the stress test results, consider the following optimizations:

1. **Performance Tuning:**
   - Monitor response times under load
   - Optimize database queries if response times degrade
   - Consider connection pooling for high concurrency

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Review timeout configurations
   - Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies
   - Add retry mechanisms for transient failures

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Set up alerts for response time thresholds
   - Monitor memory usage patterns
   - Track error rates in production

4. **Scalability:**
   - Consider horizontal scaling for high load scenarios
   - Implement load balancing if needed
   - Monitor resource utilization trends

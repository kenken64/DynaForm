# NDI Webhook Integration Complete

## Overview
Successfully converted the Next.js webhook handler to Express.js and integrated it into the main FormBT application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Express Route Files
- **TypeScript Route**: `server/src/routes/ndi-webhook.ts`
- **JavaScript Route**: `server/src/routes/ndi-webhook.js`

Both files implement:
- `POST /api/ndi-webhook` - Receives webhook data from NDI
- `GET /api/ndi-webhook` - Allows frontend polling for latest proof

### 2. Integrated into Main App
Updated `server/src/routes/index.ts`:
- Added import for ndi-webhook routes
- Mounted the route under `/api/ndi-webhook`

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/ndi-webhook
- **Purpose**: Receive webhook notifications from NDI services
- **Body**: JSON payload from NDI
- **Response**: `{ received: true }`
- **Special Handling**: Stores proofs of type "present-proof/presentation-result"

### GET /api/ndi-webhook
- **Purpose**: Allow frontend to poll for latest proof data
- **Response**: `{ proof: latestProof }` (or `{ proof: null }` if none)

## Features
- **In-memory storage**: Latest proof is stored in memory (resets on server restart)
- **Type filtering**: Only stores presentation-result type proofs
- **Error handling**: Proper error responses and logging
- **Console logging**: Debug output for incoming webhooks

## Usage Example

### Sending a webhook (from NDI):
```bash
curl -X POST https://formbt.com/api/ndi-webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "present-proof/presentation-result",
    "data": {
      "verified": true,
      "credentials": [...]
    }
  }'
```

### Polling for results (from frontend):
```bash
curl https://formbt.com/api/ndi-webhook
```

## Integration Notes
- The route is now fully integrated into the Express app structure
- Uses TypeScript for type safety
- Follows the same pattern as other routes in the application
- Ready for production use with the SSL docker-compose setup

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Add persistent storage (database) instead of in-memory storage
2. Add webhook authentication/validation
3. Add rate limiting for the webhook endpoint
4. Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
5. Create tests for the webhook functionality

## File Structure
```
server/src/routes/
├── index.ts (updated)
├── ndi-webhook.ts (new)
└── ndi-webhook.js (new)
```

The NDI webhook integration is now complete and ready for use in the FormBT application.

# NDI Verification Success Flow Update

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved
The NDI verification was completing successfully with payload `verification_result: 'ProofValidated'`, but the system was not correctly recognizing it as a successful verification and navigating to the dashboard.

## ðŸ”§ Changes Made

### 1. **Enhanced Webhook Verification Detection** (`ndi-webhook.ts`)
Updated `determineVerificationSuccess()` function to recognize NDI-specific success indicators:
- `verification_result === 'ProofValidated'`
- `type === 'present-proof/presentation-result'`
- `requested_presentation` structure (NDI specific)

### 2. **Updated Bhutan NDI Component** (`bhutan-ndi.component.ts`)
Enhanced `onVerificationSuccess()` method to:
- Detect `ProofValidated` verification results
- Extract user data from `requested_presentation.revealed_attrs`
- Auto-extract ID Number and Full Name from proof
- Pass extracted data to registration component

### 3. **Enhanced NDI Registration** (`ndi-register.component.ts`)
Updated registration component to:
- Handle pre-extracted user data from navigation state
- Support new NDI payload format with `requested_presentation`
- Auto-generate username from full name
- Auto-submit registration if all data is available
- Set default email format (`username@ndi.bt`) if needed

## ðŸ”„ New Flow

### When NDI Verification Completes:

1. **Webhook receives payload** with `verification_result: 'ProofValidated'`
2. **Enhanced detection** recognizes this as successful verification
3. **SSE broadcasts** success event to frontend
4. **Bhutan NDI component** extracts user data from `requested_presentation`
5. **Navigation** to registration form with pre-filled data
6. **Auto-submission** if all required data is available
7. **JWT tokens generated** and user redirected to dashboard

## ðŸ“‹ Payload Structure Handled

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "NDI verification completed successfully",
  "data": {
    "type": "present-proof/presentation-result",
    "verification_result": "ProofValidated",
    "requested_presentation": {
      "revealed_attrs": {
        "attr1_referent": {
          "raw": "11234567890123456789",  // ID Number
          "encoded": "..."
        },
        "attr2_referent": {
          "raw": "John Doe Tester",       // Full Name
          "encoded": "..."
        }
      }
    },
    "relationship_did": "...",
    "thid": "..."
  },
  "analysis": {
    "likelySuccess": true,      // Now correctly detects success
    "hasProofData": true,       // Now correctly detects proof data
    "hasUserData": true         // Now correctly detects user data
  }
}
```

## ðŸš€ Expected Result

When you receive the NDI verification payload:
1. âœ… Webhook correctly identifies it as successful verification
2. âœ… User data is extracted from `requested_presentation`
3. âœ… Registration form is pre-filled with name and generated username
4. âœ… Auto-submission creates user account and JWT tokens
5. âœ… User is redirected to dashboard automatically

The flow now properly handles the NDI `ProofValidated` result and navigates to the dashboard! ðŸŽ‰

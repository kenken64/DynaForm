# NDI Verification Logic Update - ProofValidated Only

## üîÑ Change Summary

Updated the NDI verification determination logic in the public form component to strictly validate only `"ProofValidated"` results as positive, treating all other verification results as negative/failed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Previous Logic (Less Strict)

The component was previously accepting multiple conditions as positive verification:
```typescript
// OLD - Multiple acceptance criteria
const isProofValidated = eventData?.verification_result === 'ProofValidated';
const isPresentationResult = eventData?.type === 'present-proof/presentation-result';
const hasValidData = eventData?.data || eventData?.revealed_attrs || eventData?.requested_presentation;

if (isProofValidated || isPresentationResult) {
  if (hasValidData) {
    // Accept as valid
  }
}
```

## ‚úÖ New Logic (Strict ProofValidated Only)

Now the component only accepts exactly `"ProofValidated"` as a successful verification:
```typescript
// NEW - Only ProofValidated is accepted
const isProofValidated = eventData?.verification_result === 'ProofValidated';

if (isProofValidated) {
  // Only accept when verification_result is exactly "ProofValidated"
  this.onNdiVerificationSuccess({ data: eventData });
} else {
  // All other results are treated as failed verification
  this.ndiError = 'NDI verification failed. Please try again.';
}
```

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. Updated `processNdiVerificationEvent()` Method
- **Removed**: Multiple acceptance criteria (`isPresentationResult`, `hasValidData`)
- **Simplified**: Single check for `verification_result === 'ProofValidated'`
- **Enhanced**: Clear logging of exact verification result received

### 2. Updated `onNdiVerificationSuccess()` Method
- **Removed**: OR condition with `present-proof/presentation-result`
- **Simplified**: Single check for `verification_result === 'ProofValidated'`
- **Enhanced**: Better error logging with actual received value

## üìã Validation Flow

1. **SSE Event Received** ‚Üí `processNdiVerificationEvent()` called
2. **Event Data Check** ‚Üí Validate event data exists
3. **Strict Validation** ‚Üí Check if `verification_result === 'ProofValidated'`
4. **Success Path** ‚Üí Call `onNdiVerificationSuccess()` if ProofValidated
5. **Failure Path** ‚Üí Set error message for any other result
6. **Double Check** ‚Üí `onNdiVerificationSuccess()` validates again
7. **Form Access** ‚Üí Load form only after double validation passes

## üö´ Results Now Treated as Failed

Any verification result other than exactly `"ProofValidated"` is now treated as failed, including:
- `"ProofRejected"`
- `"ProofInvalid"`
- `"ProofTimeout"`
- `"ProofError"`
- `null` or `undefined`
- Any other string value
- Missing `verification_result` field

## üîç Enhanced Logging

Added detailed logging to track verification results:
```typescript
console.log(`üîç Verification result: "${eventData?.verification_result}" - Valid: ${isProofValidated}`);
```

This helps with debugging and monitoring the exact verification results received from the backend.

## ‚úÖ Benefits

1. **Stricter Security**: Only confirmed valid proofs allow form access
2. **Clear Validation**: Unambiguous success criteria
3. **Better Debugging**: Clear logging of verification results
4. **Consistent Logic**: Same validation in both processing methods
5. **Error Clarity**: Clear feedback on why verification failed

The public form now implements the strictest possible NDI verification validation, ensuring only genuinely validated proofs grant access to form submission capabilities.

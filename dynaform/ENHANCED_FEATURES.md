## Expected JSON Format

```json
{
  "forms": [{
    "title": "Employee Registration Form",
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "Full Name",
        "type": "textbox",
        "value": ""
      },
      {
        "name": "Date of Birth",
        "type": "textbox",
        "value": ""
      },
      {
        "name": "Comments or Feedback",
        "type": "textarea", 
        "value": ""
      },
      {
        "name": "I agree to the terms",
        "type": "checkbox",
        "value": false
      },
      {
        "name": "Preferred Contact Method",
        "type": "checkbox",
        "value": {
          "Email": false,
          "Phone": false,
          "Mail": false
        }
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

## What Was Changed

### TypeScript Component (`app.component.ts`)
1. **Enhanced `buildForm()` method** with switch case for different field types
2. **Added helper methods** to determine field types:
   - `isTextField()`
   - `isTextAreaField()`
   - `isSingleCheckbox()`
   - `isCheckboxGroup()`
3. **Improved form submission** with detailed data processing
4. **Better boolean handling** for checkboxes
5. **Added `formTitle` property** to store and display form titles
6. **Enhanced response parsing** to extract form titles from AI response

### HTML Template (`app.component.html`)
1. **Separate rendering logic** for each field type
2. **Material Design textarea** with proper styling
3. **Single checkbox** with clean container
4. **Enhanced checkbox groups** with better spacing
5. **Conditional rendering** based on field types
6. **Form title display** with conditional rendering when title is detected

### CSS Styles (`app.component.css`)
1. **Added styling** for single checkbox containers
2. **Improved spacing** for checkbox items
3. **Better visual hierarchy** for form elements
4. **Form title styling** with Material Design theme colors
5. **Title divider** for visual separation

### AI Service (`describe-image.service.ts`)
1. **Enhanced prompt** with clear field type instructions
2. **Better examples** for different field types
3. **Clearer JSON structure** requirements
4. **Form title extraction** instructions added to AI prompt

## Form Title Feature Details

### How It Works
1. **AI Analysis**: The enhanced AI prompt specifically instructs the model to identify the main title or heading of the form
2. **Title Detection**: Looks for the largest text at the top of the form, typically the form's main title
3. **Conditional Display**: Only displays the title if one is detected (when `formTitle` is not null)
4. **Styling**: Title is styled with Material Design theme colors and proper typography

### Visual Design
- **Color**: Primary blue (#1976d2) to match Material Design theme
- **Typography**: Large, bold text with letter spacing
- **Layout**: Centered with a decorative divider below
- **Spacing**: Proper margin and padding for visual hierarchy

## Leave Period Section Detection ðŸ†•

### Structured Field Recognition
The system now specifically detects structured leave period sections like:
```
2.3. Leave Period
(a) From ________________ 
(b) To ________________ 
(c) No. of days: ___________
```

### Enhanced Features
- **Automatic Separation**: Detects and separates numbered/lettered sub-fields (a), (b), (c) into individual fields
- **Proper Field Types**: 
  - "From" field â†’ Date picker (type="date")
  - "To" field â†’ Date picker (type="date") 
  - "No. of days" â†’ Number input (type="number" for numeric fields, type="textbox" for others)
- **Visual Grouping**: Related fields are visually grouped in a special "Leave Period" section
- **Enhanced Styling**: Blue-themed section with responsive layout

### AI Prompt Improvements
- **Section Detection**: Looks specifically for numbered sections like "2.3. Leave Period"
- **Field Type Assignment**: Automatically assigns "date" type to From/To fields for proper date picker rendering
- **Sub-field Extraction**: Extracts each lettered sub-field as a separate form field

## Testing the Implementation

To test the new functionality:

1. Upload a PDF form that contains:
   - **A clear form title** at the top
   - Regular text input fields
   - Large text areas/comment boxes
   - Single checkboxes (yes/no)
   - Multiple checkbox groups
   - **A structured leave period section** with fields like "From", "To", and "No. of days"

2. The AI should now properly identify and categorize:
   - **Form title** (displayed prominently)
   - Field types with improved accuracy
   - **Leave period sections** with correct sub-field detection

3. The dynamic form will render:
   - Text inputs with single-line Material Design fields
   - Textareas with multi-line Material Design fields
   - Single checkboxes with proper boolean handling
   - Checkbox groups with multiple selectable options
   - Leave period fields with appropriate date pickers and number inputs

4. Form submission will show detailed breakdown of field types and values

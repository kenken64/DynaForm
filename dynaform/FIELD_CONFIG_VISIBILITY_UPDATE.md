# Field Configuration Badge Visibility Update

## Changes Made

### Problem
Field configuration badges were showing for all fields that had any configuration, even if they were empty or contained irrelevant configurations. This cluttered the UI unnecessarily.

### Solution
Updated the form viewer to only show configuration badges when fields have **relevant** configurations:
- **Mandatory** fields (required fields)
- **Validation** fields (fields with validation rules)

### Files Modified

#### 1. **form-viewer.component.html**
- Updated the conditional display logic: `*ngIf="hasRelevantConfiguration(field.name)"`
- Changed the badge iteration to use: `*ngFor="let config of getRelevantConfigurations(field.name)"`
- Added clearer comment explaining the purpose

#### 2. **form-viewer.component.ts**
Added two new methods:

```typescript
// Check if field has relevant configurations (mandatory or validation only)
hasRelevantConfiguration(fieldName: string): boolean {
  const configs = this.getFieldConfiguration(fieldName);
  return configs.includes('mandatory') || configs.includes('validation');
}

// Get only relevant configurations (mandatory and validation)
getRelevantConfigurations(fieldName: string): string[] {
  const configs = this.getFieldConfiguration(fieldName);
  return configs.filter(config => config === 'mandatory' || config === 'validation');
}
```

### Behavior Changes

#### Before:
- Configuration badges would show for ANY field that had configurations
- Could show empty or irrelevant configuration badges
- Cluttered UI with unnecessary visual elements

#### After:
- ✅ Configuration badges ONLY show when field is **mandatory** OR has **validation**
- ✅ Clean UI - no unnecessary badges
- ✅ Clear visual indicators for important field requirements
- ✅ Maintains all existing functionality for required fields

### Visual Impact

**Fields that will show badges:**
- Mandatory fields → Show "⭐ Mandatory" badge
- Validation fields → Show "✅ Validation" badge  
- Fields with both → Show both badges

**Fields that will NOT show badges:**
- Regular optional fields with no special requirements
- Fields with empty configurations
- Fields with other non-relevant configurations

### Benefits

1. **Cleaner UI** - Reduces visual clutter
2. **Better UX** - Users only see relevant field indicators
3. **Clearer Communication** - Badges now clearly indicate field requirements
4. **Maintained Functionality** - All existing validation and mandatory field logic still works
5. **Performance** - Slightly better rendering performance with fewer DOM elements

The configuration badges now serve their intended purpose: clearly indicating fields that have special requirements (mandatory or validation) without cluttering the interface with unnecessary visual elements.

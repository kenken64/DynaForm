## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Upload single-page PDF → Verify no carousel controls
2. Upload multi-page PDF → Verify carousel functionality
3. Test keyboard navigation → Arrow keys, Home, End
4. Test mobile responsiveness → Touch navigation
5. Test accessibility → Screen reader compatibility

### User Experience Testing
1. Navigation intuitiveness
2. Visual feedback quality
3. Mobile usability
4. Accessibility compliance
5. Performance on various devices

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions

## Conclusion

The carousel implementation successfully provides an intuitive way to navigate multiple form images while maintaining the clean, simple interface when only one image is present. The implementation follows accessibility best practices and integrates seamlessly with the existing Material Design interface.

The feature enhances the user experience by allowing users to:
